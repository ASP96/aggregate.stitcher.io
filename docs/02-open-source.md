# Open Source

We've deliberately open sourced the code of this project. 
We believe that OSS is the best way of moving this project forward.

As so, you're encouraged to report issues via GitHub, 
and are very welcome to submit PRs.
Please keep follow the coding style, you should always run `composer format` to run php cs fixer.

## Testing

Keep in mind that your PRs will only be accepted when fully tested. 
We are willing to help you through PR feedback though, 
so don't worry to ask for feedback early on.
